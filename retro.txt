# What did you feel

Appreciative, that Lewis wanted to follow my intention. Thanks!

Bad, that we didn't get as far while I was driving for Lewis -
    Very complex, a lot of catching up to do
    We should let the Navigator talk (and ask us questions as needed)

    (Lewis's take: Asked for input, and got it - Not a problem)

# What did you notice

   "Completion Bias"?  When you complete something, you get a good dopamine hit (i.e. it feels good!)

    IF you try to fix something, and it breaks more tests than were originally broken - It's probably not a "fix"
        (It's a new bug, or maybe just some refactoring to consider)
        Keep an eye on that "X failed" count at the bottom!

# What did you learn

    Always stop at a place where you know what the next step is!
        This was a great example...
    
        Consider stopping earlier (sacrificing some time) to end a session cleanly.

        If you leave when you're happy (with dopamine in your brain), it makes you want to come back!
            Leaving something incomplete, or with a bug, can make you feel bad about the code
    
    Capturing your TODO and FIXME comments in code can be helpful! (But keep them clean, delete them later)
        Or in your Commit notes!

    TDD can help you evaluate new changes...
