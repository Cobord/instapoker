Dave S:
    Shorter, more scripted / to-the-point introduction

Dave M:
    Tries to help us keep coding, and prompts us when necessary. (Appreciated!)

Lewis:
    Appreciated the intro, especially with a new member visiting
    Why do we have a WhoopsiePoopsie exception? Weird name, questionable utility
        Demonstrates subtypes of exceptions
        But we could just raise ValueError (instead of custom subclasses)
        (also the name is really off-putting)

Rod
    Refactoring is potentially going to take a lot of time
    Probably won't finish today? (But that's okay)
    (Should help us compare cards a lot more cleanly)

Dave M
    Glad that Lewis called out those tests!
    Found a lot of extra bugs that would have been nasty later
    Was hoping to make more progress, but good stuff
    Getting to a Hand class is probably out of scope, but...

Lewis
    Sad that we aren't getting more specs from the boss...
    But glad that we're making progress on cleaner code
    ++ for a future Hand class (to handle Pairs vs. Highest Single Card)
        And for later things like Full Houses

Rod
    Glad to see us getting into cleaner code with our new Class
    It would be interesting to make a Hand class as well
        Could have an "add new card" method that processes the card, and updates the stats
    We're probably going to have to get rid of a lot of tests...
