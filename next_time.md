ALWAYS Make sure all new and modified files are pushed to GitHub
(because GitPod workspaces are ephemeral!)

From 4/11

Continue to refactor - Start using our new Cards in Hands
    For example, parse_hand
    Then other places that use parse_hand (to look at Card.rank instead of just rank)

Eventually, maybe finish implementing compare_pair_hands (or replace with with something Card-based?)


From 3/14

Return to work on test_call_compare_hands() and test_compare_pairs(). 

Additional compare_pair_hands logic will be necessary to show higher pairs winning against lower ones. 

Group should consider refactoring code into multiple files (e.g, pairs logic and card validation).

Maybe also consider the order of the functions in the file(s)?

Consider adding docstrings?
